                What's the difference between the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max?
            </h2>
            <small>
                iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch OLED display and the iPhone XS Max has a 6.5-inch OLED display, meaning the
                iPhone Xs Max is larger; however, other than that, there is no difference between the two new phones on
                the inside.

            <h3>
                The Insides
            </h3>
            <p>
                The iPhone Xs and iPhone XS Max use the new A12 Bionic chip. Both phones have a 6-core CPU and a 4-core
                GPU, both of which are faster and more powerful than iPhone X from last year.
            </p>

            <h3>
                The Camera
            </h3>
            <p>
                The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max both come with a dual camera system on the back that consists of an f1.8
                12MP wide-angle lens and an f2.4 12MP telephoto lens.

            <h3>
                The Video
            </h3>
            <p>
                The video capabilities are the same as the last year's iPhone X, meaning you can expect the
                iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max to have the following video specs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>4K video recording at 24 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps</li>
                <li>1080p HD video recording at 30 fps or 60 fps</li>
                <li>720p HD video recording at 30 fps</li>
                <li>Optical image stabilization for video</li>
                <li>Slo‑mo video support for 1080p at 120 fps or 240 fps</li>
